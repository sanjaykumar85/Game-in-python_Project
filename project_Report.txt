?? Page 4: Introduction

The Stone–Paper–Scissor game is a simple hand game between two players. In this project, we develop this game using Python, where a user plays against the computer. The goal is to implement logic, randomness, and interaction using core Python concepts.

?? Page 5: Concepts Used in Project (Description)

- Conditional Statements (if, elif, else)
- Loops
- Random Module (to generate computer choices)
- Input and Output Handling
- Functions (optional, if used)

import random

def get_computer_choice():
    return random.choice(['stone', 'paper', 'scissor'])

def get_winner(user, computer):
    if user == computer:
        return "It's a tie!"
    elif (user == "stone" and computer == "scissor") or \
         (user == "paper" and computer == "stone") or \
         (user == "scissor" and computer == "paper"):
        return "You win!"
    else:
        return "Computer wins!"

print("Welcome to Stone-Paper-Scissor Game!")
user_choice = input("Enter your choice (stone/paper/scissor): ").lower()
computer_choice = get_computer_choice()

print(f"Computer chose: {computer_choice}")
print(get_winner(user_choice, computer_choice))


---

?? Page 7: Working Procedure of Source Code

1. The user is prompted to input one of: stone, paper, or scissor.
2. The computer makes a random choice using the `random.choice()` function.
3. The user's choice and the computer's choice are compared using if-else logic.
4. The winner is determined based on the standard game rules.
5. The result is printed.

?? Page 8: Output (4–5 Outputs)

Example Output 1:

Enter your choice: stone
Computer chose: paper
Computer wins!

Example Output 2:

Enter your choice: paper
Computer chose: scissor
Computer wins!

Example Output 3:

Enter your choice: scissor
Computer chose: stone
Computer wins!

Example Output 4:

Enter your choice: stone
Computer chose: scissor
You win!

?? Page 9: Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the implementation of a basic game using Python. It enhances understanding of decision-making, user input handling, and randomization. This simple yet fun project reflects core logic-building skills.
